Hello world! Again. Keeping with the tradition of writing more blog engines than blog posts, I now have _two_ new blog engines. I began writing a static blog site generated from source markup using shell scripts, but then I discovered "jekyl":http://jekyllrb.com/ and "hyde":https://github.com/hyde/hyde. I decided to go with jekyll. All of my old blog links should still work, but now it is easier for me to write new blog posts (go vim!).

My New Year's resolution is to publish more of my projects (code or otherwise), so hopefully I will get around to posting about interesting things here. To start with, check out the two plugins I wrote for this blog "on github":http://github.com/bvargo. The plugins create the tag pages and post summaries.
